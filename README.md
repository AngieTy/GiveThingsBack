This page was created as a Portfolio Lab project organised by CodersLab.
The idea of the project is to create places where everyone will be able to give unnecessary items to trusted institutions.
This project includes:
 - simple contact form
 - routing reffering to the appropriate sections
 - login and registration section

Technologies and tools I use:
- ES6,
- React, 
- React - Router,
- SCSS,
- Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
