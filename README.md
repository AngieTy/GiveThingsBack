This page was created as a Portfolio Lab project organised by CodersLab.
The idea of the project is to create places where everyone will be able to give unnecessary items to trusted institutions.
This project includes:
 - simple contact form with validation and saving form in FireStore
 - routing reffering to the appropriate sections
 - working login and registration section with validation
 - GiveThings form avaible after logging/registering built with 4 main form view, summary view and "Thank You" view
 - GiveThings form is sent and saved in FireStore to the current User
 - GiveThings form contains validation
 
 
 
Things I want to do:
 - mobile version,
 
 - saving Contact form to FireStore
 - maintain login session

Stack:
- ES6,
- React, 
- React - Router,
- Redux
- SCSS,
- Firebase, FireStore

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
